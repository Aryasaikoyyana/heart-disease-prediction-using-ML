‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
A data-driven approach to predicting the risk of heart disease using classical and advanced machine learning algorithms. This project aims to assist in early diagnosis by analyzing patient health indicators and generating accurate predictions, contributing to preventive healthcare.

üìä Project Overview
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early detection is critical to improving patient outcomes and reducing risk. This project uses machine learning models trained on clinical features such as:
Age
Gender
Blood Pressure
Cholesterol Levels
ECG Results
Heart Rate
Multiple models were evaluated and compared to identify the most effective one for heart disease prediction.

üß† Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

üìà Performance Metrics
Models were evaluated using:
Accuracy
Precision
F1-Score
AUC-ROC (if implemented)

üìå Random Forest and XGBoost delivered the best overall performance in terms of accuracy and generalization.


HOW TO RUN THIS:
1.download the project either by opening command prompt and copy pasting the link or download the zip file and extract it
2.open the project in vs code
3.you must have jupyter notebook installed in u r vscode otherwise ,go to extensions and install jupyter notebook in vs code
4.you can find three dots on the right side on the vs code then click on it nd select folders
5.go open the heart-disease-predictin.jpny and you can find the run button on the top(run all) or u can run them individually

THANk YOU
